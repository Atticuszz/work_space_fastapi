# Ideas

## Design Philosophy

1. **Data-Driven Decision-Making** üìä
    - Utilizing a *multi-tag system*, custom *analysis schemes*, and reports generated by *GPT-4*, we provide users with
      data-driven decision support.

2. **Task Template System** üìù
    - Predefined task templates automatically add tags and categories, reducing manual input.

3. **Bill Management System** üíº
    - Automatically consolidate bills, categorize them with auto-labeling based on set rules, set up analysis schemes
      based on analysis templates, and automatically sync data for periodic report generation.

4. **Analysis System** üìà
    - Auto-sync data and generate charts and reports based on user-defined analysis schemes.

5. **Reminder System** ‚è∞
    - Automatically remind based on task timeliness and progress or set custom reminders like revision prompts.
      Notification methods can be emails, text messages, WeChat, or others.

## Main Features

### Multi-Level Tagging System **_(Customizable for Extending Task Types)_**

- Task Tags
- Expense Record Tags

### Task Management

- **Template System**
    - Content
        - Multi-level Classification Tags
            - What aspect? (Work, Study, Life, Entertainment, Sports, Health, Family, Social, Finance, Others)
            - Specific themes within this aspect? (Work: Project 1, Project 2, Project 3, Others)
            - Specific content of the task? (Project 1: Task 1, Task 2, Task 3, Others)
        - Timeliness # TODO: Can this be arranged like Google Calendar and sync with it?
            - Deadline/Target Period
        - Progress Units (defaults available)
            - Completion location, date, time period/(total time spent), format of progress -> format of details
    - Creation and Usage
        - After creating a template, tasks without timeliness become habitual tasks, while those with timeliness become
          planned tasks.
        - Filling in the progress unit according to the task template automatically generates a task record.

### Bill Management

1. **Consolidated Importing**
    - Alipay Bills
    - WeChat Bills
2. **Automatic Categorization**
    - Set rules for auto-tagging to avoid repetitive manual operations
3. Manual Tagging

### Analysis System

1. **Custom Analysis Tools** üìä
    - Generate charts based on basic analysis templates, choosing angles and directions for analysis
2. Automatic Data Sync
    - Automatically sync data from bills
    - Automatically sync data from tasks

3. **Automated Report Generation** üìù
    - Use the GPT-4 interface to automatically generate weekly and monthly reports, providing summaries and analyses
      based on task data.

4. **Progress Tracking** üìä
    - Update task progress in the template to automatically record detailed information.

### Reminder System

1. **Custom Reminders**
    - Deadline reminders
    - Task progress reminders
    - Review reminders

# Architecture

## Project Structure

1. Vue
    - UI
        - Vuexy + Vuetify
    - Router
        - Vue-Router
    - JS + TS

2. Back-End
    - FastAPI
        - Middleware + Typecheck + Complex Operations
    - Supabase-Py
        - Async client interaction with Supabase online
    - Metabase
        - Data analysis connected to Supabase online
        - Data cleaning scripts, e.g., combining Alipay and WeChat Pay bills
    - Backup
        - SQLite to store data locally, synced from Supabase

## Functions

1. Vue
    - Task Done List
        - CRUD operations to record tasks

## Components

1. Vue
    - Task Done List
        - Table
        - Dialog to manage tasks
        - Dialog to manage task categories

## TODO

1. Convert `TaskDoneManagement.js` to `TaskDoneManagement.ts`
2. Construct backup SQLite database from Supabase
3. Synchronize financial data
4. Construct finance analysis on Vue
5. Scrapy to get Alipay bills

## Questions

1. **Task Completion Times**
    - A task may require multiple attempts for completion, meaning only a portion of progress can be made each time.

2. **To-Do Functionality**
    - It's necessary to propose a to-do function, preferably with reminders and a deadline.

3. **Task Completion Periods**
    - A task might be split into several completion periods, or only the total time taken may be recorded, making it
      challenging to log the complete period.
